Instructions
===============

First, make sure you have the Shiny package installed (`install.packages('shiny')`).

Then check out the examples in the 'Examples' directory of this repository. You can also just launch the app from R using

    shiny::runGitHub(repo = "jgabry/post_pred_shiny")

but I recommend looking at the examples first (they will produce data in the right format for use with the app).
